# Principled Stopping and Validation for Maximum Mean Discrepancy-Based Algorithms
This code contains the implementation details for the experiments in the paper 'Principled Stopping and Validation for Maximum Mean Discrepancy-Based Algorithms'

The execution of the main experiments and the generation of raw data are implemented in [mmd_frl.py](https://github.com/yijinni250-png/uniform_mmd/blob/main/mmd_frl.py) and [mmd_gan.py](https://github.com/yijinni250-png/uniform_mmd/blob/main/mmd_gan.py), for the FRL and GAN experiments, respectively.

The analysis showing the exploratory ability of our bound is executed in [frl_analysis.py](https://github.com/yijinni250-png/uniform_mmd/blob/main/frl_analysis.py) and [gan_analysis.py](https://github.com/yijinni250-png/uniform_mmd/blob/main/gan_analysis.py), for the FRL and GAN experiments, respectively.
